* Release Notes
SH031 - Solstice MMXVIII is a compilation of improvisationally-natured tracks, recorded on or around the 2018 summer solstice, by different experimental artists up-&-down the west coast and beyond.

Side A starts off with an existentially hyperreal synth and spoken-word experiment from [[https://soapcheese.bandcamp.com/][Soapcheese]], followed by the ornate black-hole contrabass and vocal drones of [[https://unseam.bandcamp.com][Unseam]]. The next track is a live recording taken from [[https://diegeisterbeschworen.tumblr.com][die geister beschwören]]'s transmigratory freakout at the Thirst For Light Solstice festival, which is followed with noisy guitar sludge punk from [[https://magicaltrash.bandcamp.com/][Magical Trash]]. [[https://benkraftwerx.bandcamp.com/][Ben Kraftwerx]] closes out Side A with an off the-cuff guitar jam, recorded in a box truck somewhere deep in the rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula.

Side B begins with [[https://www.youtube.com/user/loopbasedzero/videos][Cyanosis]] world-building a sonic environment of prepared guitar mutations, setting the stage for a mind-melt collab from [[https://pranacrafter.bandcamp.com/][Prana Crafter]], [[https://karnaktemples.bandcamp.com/][Karnak Temples]] and [[https://idoleyes.bandcamp.com/][Idol Eyes]] featuring bits of the Prana Temple Eyes set at the 24th Olympia Experimental Music Fest. [[https://groonz.bandcamp.com/][AC Grüns]] brings his lysergic-infused brand of primitive natural House music, followed by the triumphant return of [[https://ixviiv.bandcamp.com/][IXVIIV]]'s post-industrial electronics and EBM.
The compilation closes with the brutal and necessary grinds of [[https://bucolicturmoil.bandcamp.com/][Bucolic Turmoil]] and closes with an anonymous noise mirror of self generating sequences ad infinitum from [[https://kuj5a0m2m8mxbm3.bandcamp.com/][桂字安]].
