* Release Notes
A new single from Idol Eyes! A spooky western psych tune, just in time for fall; Psicomagia conjures up images of canyons filled with backwards-masked guitars and minor-chord changes twanging away at your sanity.

*The sun is fading and a thick fog rolls in. You are standing in a meadow, watching the leaves begin to change. The sky is radiating a pink & orange energy that transmits peptides through your central nervous system. A hidden alphabet appears through photosynthesis, locution not withstanding. A single thought wraps around your brain, permeating each pore with the musk of the natural order.*

Idol Eyes has been working on his first new batch of original music since 2013 (*ZAIZHONGGUO* / *Frameworks* ). Psicomagia plays as an homage to sprawling landscapes, eigenvectors and psychotropic country blues. The B Side contains a mirrored reflection, refracted into infinite space for eons and eons.
