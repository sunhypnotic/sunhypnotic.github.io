* Release Notes
Two techy-house tunes from electronic wizard AC Grüns.

Side A starts us off with <b>Double Happyness</b>, a winding progressive journey reminescent of an alarm clock reminding you that, despite your journey through dreamland, your day still has not started.

Side B shows Grüns flirting with bass music while giving us the proverbial 'brown-note'. The skittering bass in <b>Controversies, Questions (and Strategies!!!)</b> is sure to make your feet sweat.
