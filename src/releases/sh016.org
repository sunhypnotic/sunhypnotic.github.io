* Release Notes
An epic meditative journey in four parts. SF transplant New Fast has once again re-invented himself and takes us along for the ride, focusing on time, memory, isolation and death.

Full of faded, washed out samples and jangly guitar-drones, the album takes the listener through different phases of emotion during the nearly 90 minute odyssey.

A change in geographical locations uncovered a new found energy and focus. The album is a major departure from the string of albums and EPs he had created while living in the suburban strip-mall wastelands of Mesa, AZ, showing a true evolution in production chops and technique.

Hazy beats pulled from the grooves of hip-hop, r&b and pop records create the groundwork in which this ambient garden of sound unfolds and flourishes. The latter half of the album contains tracks like <i>Another Hell</i>, <i>Spectre II</i> which shows a new-found mutant pop sensibility that feels natural in the otherwordly atmosphere of the tape.

The album was recorded in San Francisco, CA during 2013 by the man himself, using no computers. It was originally released on international net-label <a href="http://deepwhitesound.com/dws143/" target="_blank">DeepWhiteSound (DWS 143)</a> as a digital release.

The album is dedicated in loving memory to Evelyn Brooks.
