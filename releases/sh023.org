* Release Notes
For our 23rd release, Ben Kraftwerx delivers a collection of jangly, fingerpickin' acoustic freakouts alongside textured musique concrete incantations. *parsnips* (SH023) is a bundle of trance-inducing, experimental folk mutations.

These tracks are culled from numerous recording sessions across space & time. Recorded throughout the US in Arizona, Utah, Oregon and North Carolina, Kraftwerx invokes the various phantoms of highways & interstates across North America. Armed with an acoustic guitar and an array of homegrown sonic manipulators, *parsnips* blends acoustic and electronic sounds while bridging wild experimentation with classical sensibilities.


Ben Kraftwerx will be on the road throughout the US for summer 2016. We'll be releasing a compilation of his road tapes later in the year. In the meantime, check out his textual cutup ebook [The Blacksmith at Smuggler's Mine](http://sunhypnotic.com/the-blacksmith-at-smugglers-mine/).
