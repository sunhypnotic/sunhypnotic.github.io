* Release Notes
Winter has come and DONOSTIA has emerged from the shadows once again with a new cassette single, "Disappear" b/w "Out of the Way" (SH025)

After a string of digital maxi-singles, the reclusive producer offers a new-found glimpse into his psyche. These two tracks represent an alignment between the cosmos and the natural world, dissonance and harmony; pop music and the underground. Taking cues from Darkwave and Minimal Techno, this cassette single provides the perfect soundtrack as late autumn changes to winter.

DONOSTIA hails from the Sonoran Desert. After spending years fronting obscure grindcore and metal groups, he retreated into the studio to focus on the music of his childhood; synth pop from the 1980s. Transplanted to the Northlands of New Mexico USA in 2015, he embraced the desolate landscape and re-kindled his lifelong obsession with retro Synthwave and Italo Disco. Focusing on vintage synthesizers and lo-fi DIY aesthetics, DONOSTIA creates an atmosphere filled with isolation and nostalgia.
