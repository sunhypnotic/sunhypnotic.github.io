* Release Notes
All hail Substantial Drift's debut 10" record, <b>Cities of Memory (SH036)</b>. Two sides of GMO-mutated wonky techno, asychronus drum patterns and minimal synths. The A-side features patterns based on cellular automata interpolated with hallucinatory, redactive riddims.  On the B-side, we see an amalgamation of field recordings, fragmented beats and gurgling synths mashed into *almost-danceable* sequence of bleeps & bloops.



This album is released both digitally and as a limited edition run of 10" vinyl with generic black die-cut jackets.

Released May 31, 2019
