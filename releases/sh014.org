* Release Notes
DIE - Sandland (SH014) cassette

This sprawling desert narrative runs about an hour per side and covers everything from fuzzy deconstructed songs to blissful ambient meditations.

Side A presents itself as a alt-pop erosion with classics like <b>How Could You Know?</b> and <b>Steal You</b> before erasing the mood into obscurity, taking the listener through innerspace.

Side B gives the listener a vast array of sonic space to exist within. With tracks like <b>R.I.P.J.A.M.</b> and <b>Rising</b> the listener is treated with far away sounds of nostalgia which are increasingly engulfed by waves of reverb and delay.
