* Release Notes
Celebrating Idol Eyes' upcoming involvment in the DWS Stream Room project, we have a short-run vinyl of two of his fuzziest tracks. Two-track single available on limited edition, lathe-cut vinyl. Moving the listeners through fuzzy psychedelic dream space, while changing structures and form along the way.

Super limited edition brand new Idol Eyes 7 inch lathe cut records, cut in square shapes, with the grooves forming a circle within the square.
