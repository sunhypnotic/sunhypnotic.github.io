* Release Notes
Amidst clouds of billowing smoke and ambient light, SELIM X appears, bringing with him his killer debut cassette release "RIP" (SH026)

SELIM X takes a ground up approach to create a unique haze of ambient techno. Picking up where his previous projects left off (New Fast, Info), he effortlessly blends the dancefloor with cosmic, heavy-lidded indica sensibilities. Often described as "footwork for stoners", this album floats on clouds of kinetic urban energy, muted by barely-there beats and fuzzy synth lines.

Hailing from the Bay Area, this producer makes nods to the West Coast way-of-life he's come to know and love. Creating a diverse melting pot of audio, SELIM X infuses golden rays of brilliance that shine through the murky fog of reverb and delay. Lo-fi grooves and wide-open ambient fields pave the way for a solid debut album. The future is bright for SELIM X.
