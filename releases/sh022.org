* Release Notes
GR00NZ EP (SH022) starts the year with chilled mutant riddims from the Pacific Northwest.

Recorded in the soggy torrential rains of Portland, OR, AC Grüns has developed a laid-back, psychedelic landscape blending organic kicks, claps and lush orchestration alongside pulsating synths and distorted bass lines. Ripping off elements of Deep House, Broken Beat, Techno and Ambient and melting them into an amphibious affair trapped beneath the ice of winter, GR00NZ EP is sure to get heads nodding and toes tapping.

There have been rumours of another tape from Grüns later this year, a possible follow-up from his 2 hour chipmunk'd breakcore tape [Macbook Conquerah]() from 2015, however no official timeline has been given for the project.
